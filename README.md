# Rich Presence

Flawless human presence detection is the holy grail of home automation. This project aims to get closer to excellent human presence detection in a room.

mmWave (millimeter wave) sensors such as the LD2410 use the 24 GHz band to detect micro-fluctuations up to 6 meters away. With appropriate tuning, they significantly advance the capabilities of previous motion sensing techniques. Traditional PIR sensors can only reliably detect actively moving objects. They completely fail when detecting static presence (e.g. when a person is sitting and reading a book or watching TV). On the other hand, mmWave sensors can be slow to pick up on moving objects (e.g. a person entering a room) before measuring high enough signals of micro-motions to report detection. A combination of a PIR sensor as a trigger, and an mmWave sensor to maintain presence detection, can lead to ultra-fast triggers and sustained periods of human presence detection with little to no motion on behalf of present humans. Such functionality is particulary useful for automated lighting in a smart home.
